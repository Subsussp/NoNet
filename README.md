## 🔐 Admin Access

To explore the admin features, use the following credentials:

- **Email:** `admin1@gmail.com`  
- **Password:** `11`

You're also free to create your own account, but it will be a regular user account without admin privileges.

## ✅ Key Features

- 🔑 User authentication system (register/login/logout)
- 🛒 Fully functional cart and checkout flow
- 📦 Order system with backend integration
- 🗺️ Address selection via interactive map

## ⚠️ Note

This is still a work-in-progress. A few features are either incomplete or simplified due to time constraints, but the core systems are up and running.
